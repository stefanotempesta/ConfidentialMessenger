# ConfidentialMessenger
ConfidentialMessenger is a web chat application that demonstrates the use of Azure confidential computing features to protect data. The application modifies and builds on a simple web chat application described in the following tutorial, https://pusher.com/tutorials/chat-aspnet/. The main modification is to use Azure confidential computing technologies to store the contacts list which is considered to be a sensitive data for the system. 
The two ways the contact list is to be stored is: 
  a. stored in a confidential database created in this way,confidential database you create in this way: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves?view=sql-server-ver15
  b. stored in a confidential enclave which can be created in Azure using a special VM: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/quick-create-portal
  
# A. Using Confidential SQL Database

The simpler way to include confidential computing in your application is to use an Azure SQL database with such support. To learn more about confidential SQL databases, refer to the following document.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves?view=sql-server-ver15

1. The first step in replicating this system is to provision an Azure SQL database that supports confidential computing. Steps 1 and 2 of the tutorial in the link will show how to setup an Azure SQL database with Always Encrypted enclaves.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/always-encrypted-enclaves-getting-started

2. Clone/download the code in this repository and open the project/solution for ConfidentialMessenger in your IDE. There is no need for the ContactsEnclave system when using the confidential database option.

3. In the appsettings.json file, plugin the values for the confidential SQL database created in step 1 to the ConnectionString/WebChatContext property. You can find the actual values for the connection string in the database's overview section in the Azure portal.
Example:
   Server=<server name and port; check for the value in the Azure portal>;Initial Catalog=<database name>;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=<admin username>;Password=<password>;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;Column Encryption Setting = Enabled;Attestation Protocol = AAS; Enclave Attestation Url = <attestation URL you created in Step 1>;
Also, set the value of the ContactListSource property to "DB".
  
4. Execute a Powershell command to create the database schema for ConfidentialMessenger in the blank database created in Step 1. In your Visual Studio IDE, go to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console and then run the following command:
   Update-Database
   This command will create the Users and Conversations table. The Users table is the contact list and would be used to store encrypted user names and their corresponding auto-generated IDs. The Conversations table will store the chat messages.

5. Provision enclave-enabled keys for your database and then set the name column in the User Table to be Always Encrypted. Use Steps 4 and 5 in the following tutorial as a guide on how to create enclave-enabled keys and set a specified column to be encrypted using those keys.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/always-encrypted-enclaves-getting-started

6. The setup of the system is complete and the application can be run and tested locally. Use the Start Debugging/Start without Debugging command on Visual Studio which should open a page in your browser showing you the login page for the ConfidentialMessenger. The username is not case-sensitive. If a username does not exist in the contacts list, that username will be added and the user will be signed and logged in. If the username already exists, the user will be logged in with that username and his/her conversations will be retrieved as necessary.

# B. Using Confidential Enclave in Special Azure VM
You can also use a confidential enclave in a special Azure VM to store sensitive data. In this application, the contacts list data is stored in a VM enclave. The ContactsEnclave C++ application uses the openenclave architecture to store and process the contacts list and acts as a REST server to client applications requesting such data. 

# I. ContactsEnclave
First, we will setup the ContactsEnclave REST server, the C++ application deployed in the Azure VM which leverages confidential computing support and used to manage and store the contacts list, considered to be sensitive data. 
1. The first step is to provision an Azure virtual machine that supports confidential computing. Follow the instructions in this tutorial (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/quick-create-portal) up to the installation of the Open Enclave SDK. For the purpose of the ConfidentialMessenger system, the VM size selected was Standard DC1s_v2 (1 vcpus, 4 GiB memory) and the VM operating system used was Linux (ubuntu 18.04), though other options are possible depending on need and preference.

2. Connect to the server using Putty or other SSH terminal, clone the ConfidentialMessenger repository in your home directory.
3. Navigate to the ContactsEnclave -> host folder, and then clone and build the Restbed repository.
    https://github.com/Corvusoft/restbed#build
4. Navigate to the ContactsEnclave directory and run the following commands:
    . /opt/openenclave/share/openenclave/openenclaverc
    make build
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="./ContactsEnclave/host/restbed/distribution/library"
    nohup make run
5. The ContactsEnclave server will now be running. Verify by opening another terminal and running the following curl command
    curl -w'\n' -v -XGET 'http://localhost:1984/users'
    
# II. ConfidentialMessenger
The ConfidentialMessenger is the .NET Core/C# web chat application. It is designedto be deployed alongside the ContactsEnclave application.
1. In Visual Studio, open the project/solution inside the ConfidentialMessenger folder.
2. In the appsettings.json file, set the value of the ContactListSource property to "VM". The application needs an SQL database to store the Conversations data, so a ConnectionString to a SQL Server database needs to be provided.
  Ex.  "WebChatContext": "Server=tcp:confmsgrdbserver.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=confmsgrdb;Persist Security Info=False;User ID={username};Password={password};MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
3. Execute a Powershell command to create the database schema for ConfidentialMessenger in the database specified. In your Visual Studio IDE, go to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console. Create the tables in your database by running the following command:
   Update-Database
   This command will create the Users and Conversations table. The Users table is not going to be used as users data is going to be stored in the enclave. The Conversations table will store the chat messages.
4. Publish the application to a local folder.
5. Using an FTP client, copy the publish folder and contents to your home directory in the VM
6. Create an NGINX service to host the web application. Refer to the following resource:
    https://hbhhathorn.medium.com/install-an-asp-net-core-web-api-on-linux-ubuntu-18-04-and-host-with-nginx-and-ssl-2ed9df7371fb
5. Open a browser and navigate to the web application.
